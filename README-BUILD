-= HOW TO MAKE RPM/DEB/TAR.GZ PACKAGES =-

Go to ./scripts/package.
Run 'make'.
It will export the sources from Bazaar, build ShParser.pm module (the 'eyapp'
tool is needed!), and make packages of all the types.


-= HOW TO REBUILD sh-cmdlist-* FILES FROM THE LSB DATABASE (devel) =-

Run 'LSBUSER=lsbuser LSBDBPASSWD=<pwd> LSBDB=lsb LSBDBHOST=<host> make gensrc'.
It would run './scripts/mkcmdlist2' tool which would connect to the DB and write
the sh-cmdlist-* files.

The up-to-date versions of these files should be already in the bzr branch.
